## My Blog

A minimal blog based on Markdown and Hugo.

### (Deprecated) Org-Mode + Hugo

This blog was originally written in Emacs Org mode, where the webpages were generated by the following procedure:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A([Org Mode]) -- Ox-hugo --> B[Markdown] -- Hugo --> C[HTML]
```

### Running Locally

To run the website on port 1313, simply run `./run.sh`, or:
```sh
hugo server --buildDrafts --navigateToChanged
```
